Recommended Videos Joel showed what was really lurking beneath his gruff facade when he was stacking those rocks in The Last of Us. He’s not known for being forthcoming with his emotions. He doesn’t speak much and when he does, he keeps it brief without revealing anything more than what he wants people to know, but he’s far from emotionless, as hard as he might try to prove otherwise."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He’s not known for being forthcoming with his emotions. He doesn’t speak much and when he does, he keeps it brief without revealing anything more than what he wants people to know, but he’s far from emotionless, as hard as he might try to prove otherwise.</p><p data-characters=300 data-current-count=686 data-injectable=true>Episode three opens up with Joel kneeling by a babbling broke all by his lonesome. He’s stacking rocks and looking pensive, but no other details are given as to why he’s performing this ritual. In <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">HBO’s The Last of Us Podcast</a>, co-creator Craig Mazin answered this question in full.</p><p>“We thought it was important to show that Pedro (Pascal)—Joel missed her, that he was mourning her and in his very simple way just making a small cairn of rocks to say, ‘I’m sorry, I blew it, I lost you.’ It’s as much about self-recrimination and doubt as it is about mourning, but it was important for us to show that he cared simply because we know the story becomes about Joel and Ellie.”</p><p data-characters=443 data-current-count=443 data-injectable=true>In episode two, Joel, Tess, and Elli travel through the ruins of Boston to bring the young girl to a Firefly base camp. They encounter zombies along the way and Tess gets infected. She tells Joel that he needs to continue on with the mission and to hold onto hope before she sacrifices herself by exploding the zombies who’re coming after them. Joel keeps on moving without commenting on it, but his small act proved how much he cared.</p><p data-characters=138 data-current-count=138 data-injectable=false>Mazin said that this was purposeful and that the show needed to have a transition between Joel caring for Tess and then caring for Ellie.</p><p>“We didn’t want Joel to already be, ‘Okay, it’s me and you kid. Let’s go.’ There was a moment where we had to stop and acknowledge what happened and similarly, there was a need for Ellie to address it because we understood that pretty quickly in this episode we needed them to start talking.”</p><p data-characters=372 data-current-count=372 data-injectable=false>Episode three was an emotionally charged story about a survivalist named Bill who’s isolated himself in a town and meets a man named Frank. Bill’s a lot like Joel and doesn’t want to open himself up to anyone else, but over the course of the story, he learns that that’s his mission, to take care of others, and it’s Joel’s purpose too.</p><p data-characters=400 data-current-count=772 data-injectable=true>Joel and Ellie are having to work together without Tess and there are definitely some hurdles they have to get past, but they’re slowly becoming more comfortable with each other. Joel’s life is filled with tragedy, and Ellie has much to understand about how to survive and about the past. This episode was the first step of this dynamic between them and it becomes the heart of the story.</p><p data-characters=204 data-current-count=204 data-injectable=false>Joel stacking rocks wasn’t the only part of the episode that had a deeper meaning. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last of Us director Peter Hoar explained that the last shot of episode three held significant meaning</a> as well.</p><p data-characters=91 data-current-count=295 data-injectable=false>The Last of Us&nbsp;is currently streaming on HBO Max, with new episodes released every Sunday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e9OhnGakkajBbrvFZqysZaOdvLi%2B1Kelnqpdp7K3scClqmasmJp6qbHAq6ubqpWWuKq6xmapnpmjpLtursShoKecXZ%2B8prjSZqqtmZOgerCyjKumnKOjYravecSpoKynlJp6dHs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

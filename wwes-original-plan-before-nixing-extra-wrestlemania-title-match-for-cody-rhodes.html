The Rock was once thoughtto be virtual lock for WrestleMania 39."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Logan Paul is back in WWE, and he’s gunning for Seth Rollins, with a WrestleMania encounter on the horizon. This still-to-be-booked match was not the original plan for the Drip God. It also wasn’t the original plan for Cody Rhodes.</p><p>The Rock was once thought<a href=#> to be virtual lock for WrestleMania 39</a>. His opponent would have been Roman Reigns in SoFi Stadium, but The Great One said he couldn’t get ready in time for the big match. During that time, Cody Rhodes stepped up to win the Royal Rumble match and punch his ticket to WrestleMania.</p><p>According to a report from Fightful Select, the rumored match between Seth Rollins vs Drew McIntyre or Cody Rhodes is obviously not happening, nor will it be for an additional title. That move would split up Roman Reigns’ Undisputed WWE Universal Title. That being said, WWE had an interesting way of pencilling in Cody Rhodes’ spot on the WrestleMania card.</p><p>The idea of holding an additional title match was eventually nixed, and we saw things come together as they are today. Still, the “TBA” that WWE had noted on the run-down could have belonged to The Rock.</p><p>Seth Rollins vs. Cody Rhodes or Drew McIntyre Title Match: A lot has changed since November, clearly, because none of these three people are involved with each other at all. Rundowns as of that period had two title matches happening, this one on night one, and another on night two.</p><p>Cody Rhodes was listed as an option for both of them, with “TBA/Cody Rhodes vs. Roman Reigns” being set as a WWE Universal Title match, and Rollins vs. Rhodes/Drew as a WWE Championship match.</p><p>It was also noted that, “Rhodes was always set to win the Royal Rumble as one would expect, but the Drew McIntyre/Sheamus team took off, and Seth Rollins moved on to Logan Paul, and the extra title match was nixed altogether.”</p><p>We will have to see how the WrestleMania 39 card comes together as we approach the show of shows. Now, the Superstars involved in those high-profile feuds will just have to bring it every time they’re on television to build momentum toward the big event on April 1st and 2nd.</p><p><strong>What’s your take on WWE’s plan for WrestleMania?

As an actor, as soon as I learn something, I want to share it. I grew up in a community with a lot of different people from all over the world. My neighborhood was full of people from different backgrounds. You learned things all the time. Maybe that was one of the effects that helped me to become an actor. Learning and sharing.”</p><p data-characters=267 data-current-count=267 data-injectable=false>Before more Lupin comes back, Sy will be seen next in Father & Soldier and in Jurassic World Dominion.

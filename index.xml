I am not trying to excuse the actions of the corrupt police officers in your program, but this report seemed very biased against Blacks and Hispanics.</description></item><item><title>Elijah Wood reacts to first look at Lord of the Rings: War of the Rohirrim</title><link>/elijah-wood-reacts-to-first-look-at-lord-of-the-rings-war-of-the-rohirrim.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/elijah-wood-reacts-to-first-look-at-lord-of-the-rings-war-of-the-rohirrim.html</guid><description>Everyone’s favorite Hobbit is reacting to the news of a new anime feature film set in Middle Earth, Lord of the Rings: War of the Rohirrim.

Takafumi's masochism is, in that sense, not treated seriously—sorry, "Fifty Shades of Grey" fans!—because it's just the catalyst for a series of abidingly strange episodes that are all about one thing: escaping the hell that is yourself. Matsumoto's style of comedy is, in that sense, a far-flung descendant of Jerry Lewis' slapstick-y, self-loathing schtick. "R100" is, consequently, a comedy that tries to alienate you by suggesting that escapism is futile, all things inevitably devolve, and nothing inherently means anything.</description></item><item><title>Smiths Food and Drug Application Online: Jobs &amp;amp; Career Info</title><link>/smiths-food-and-drug-application.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/smiths-food-and-drug-application.html</guid><description>Job seekers can submit online application forms through Kroger’s career website to get an opportunity to work with Smith’s Food and Drug.

They are considered the beings of life, destruction and order respectively.</p><p>Contrary to the main pattern of <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Legendary group">legendary trios</a>; this trio, at least one of them <a href=# title="Zygarde (Pokémon)">Zygarde</a>, has a different base stat distribution total. <a href=# title="Xerneas (Pokémon)">Xerneas</a> and <a href=# title="Yveltal (Pokémon)">Yveltal</a> have a base stat total of 680. Zygarde, on the other hand has different base stat distribution and total for each of its forms.</p><p>The trio was themed after the concept of mortality, order, or equilibrium of life and death; and are named after the last three letters of the alphabet or the axes of the Cartesian coordinate system. Xerneas is considered the being of life, having said to have shared eternal life, and exudes a revitalizing aura; Xerneas also represents the letter X. Yveltal is known as the being of destruction, possessing the reputation of a destructive nature; Yveltal represents the letter Y. Zygarde, their internal <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Legendary group">trio master</a>, is renowned as the being of balance, it is said to have monitoring the ecosystem. And when the ecosystem falls into disorder, Zygarde unleashes its true power; Zygarde represents the letter Z.</p><p>The abilities of this trio only interacts when only these three are in battle, Xerneas with <a href=# title="Fairy Aura (Ability)">Fairy Aura</a>, Yveltal with <a href=# title="Dark Aura (Ability)">Dark Aura</a> and Zygarde 50% forme, with <a href=# title="Aura Break (Ability)">Aura Break</a>. In <a href=# title="Pokémon Rumble World">Pokémon Rumble World</a>, there is a title that can be earned through befriending these Pokémon. The title is called "Aura Traveller." Thus the name Aura Trio.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Mythology>Mythology</span></h2><h3><span id=The_Legend_of_X.2C_Y.2C_and_Z></span><span class=mw-headline id=The_Legend_of_X,_Y,_and_Z>The Legend of X, Y, and Z</span></h3><p>As seen in <a href=# title=XYS05><i>The Legend of X, Y, and Z!</i></a>, the three Legendary Pokémon have guarded the equilibrium of mortality in the Kalos region since ancient times. In the story of <a href=# title=Jan>Jan</a> and <a href=# title=Aila>Aila</a>, these Pokémon were involved. Jan was in love with Aila, despite their different social status, with Jan at the lower tiers of society and Aila being wealthy. <a href=# title="Yveltal (Pokémon)">Yveltal</a> ever since have caused multiple destructive deeds in their village. To be proof of Jan's love, Aila's father sent him to a quest to slay Yveltal, to put an end to the village's suffering. One day, Jan said his plan to Aila and set off. Not even a kilometer of journeying, Yveltal appeared in front of Aila. Jan rushed back and the Pokémon's attention turned to the man. Yveltal was about to <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Oblivion Wing">beam</a> Jan but Aila intervened to protect him. In return, Aila petrified as she received Yveltal's beam. Jan berated in grief of Aila's petrification. He seeked the help of <a href=# title=Olympica>Olympica</a>, the village's mage. Olympica said that to restore Aila's normal state, he would have to seek <a href=# title="Xerneas (Pokémon)">Xerneas</a>, the Legendary Pokémon of life. For years, Jan seeked Xerneas in hope to restore Aila. Meanwhile, in a nearby country, <a href=# title=Veofum>Veofum</a>, a greedy king, wanted to forcibly harness Xerneas' power to make his country more fertile. Veofum's troops seeked Xerneas and encountered it in its tree form, so they unrooted it and brought it to the kingdom. Xerneas would not help Veofum, so Veofum tried to burn it in thinking that it is worthless. Jan arrived at odds in Veofum's kingdom. He tried to stop the burning of the tree, but to no avail. Zygarde's cells saw the tragic event and transformed into a 50% forme <a href=# title="Zygarde (Pokémon)">Zygarde</a>. Zygarde's <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Land's Wrath">wrath</a> brought the king and his troops to their demise, while Jan and Xerneas were left safe. Xerneas pronged away even if it saw Jan seeking for help. Jan returned to his village, now deserted and barren with only the Lady Statue, Aila, left. He just dedicated his life to restoring the village to its fertile state. The village grew, with some people returning. A drought struck the area. Xerneas appeared and <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Fairy Aura">revitalized</a> the village, making every plant and tree flourishing. Still, Aila hasn't been unpetrified. Jan stayed with Aila as the years passed by and died by her side. To this day, Aila's Statue is still not unpetrified.</p><h2><span id=Evidences.2FOrigins></span><span class=mw-headline id=Evidences/Origins>Evidences/Origins</span></h2><p>There are two theories that show evidence of the trio being interrelated:</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=3-dimensional_coordinate_system_Theory><i>3-dimensional coordinate system Theory</i></span></h3><p>During an interview with <a href=# title="Ken Sugimori">Ken Sugimori</a>, <a href=# title="Pokémon X and Y">Pokémon X and Y</a>'s Art Director, he revealed that the legendaries were based on the axes of the Cartesian coordinate system, apt with the first games to use fully fledged 3D graphics in the Pokémon game core series. The x-axis is spread horizontally, which reflects Xerneas' residence on land, the y-axis is positioned vertically, or pointing upwards, which reflects Yveltal's avian feats. The z-axis, only present when graphing 3-dimensional figures, means depth; reflecting Zygarde's residence underground.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Yggdrasil_Theory><i>Yggdrasil Theory</i></span></h3><p>In Norse Mythology, there exists the world tree, <a href=# class=extiw title=wp:Yggdrasil>Yggdrasil</a>, which holds all the realms of the said continuity. There are beasts that reside in the said tree, there are deer in <a href=# class=extiw title=wp:Asgard>Asgard</a>, an hawk on top of the tree, and a serpent in <a href=# class=extiw title=wp:Midgard>Midgard</a>.</p><p>The deer, namely <a href=# class=extiw title="wp:Dáinn, Dvalinn, Duneyrr and Duraþrór">Dáinn, Dvalinn, Duneyrr and Durathrór</a>, are four stags that gnaw on the branches of Yggdrasil, the reason why Xerneas has four differently coloured pairs of horns. There are some rumors circulating that these 4 stags have their horns the color of Xerneas', but no evidence shows this feature. Another deer, called <a href=# class=extiw title=wp:Eikthyrnir>Eikthyrnir</a>, is a stag that stands on <a href=# class=extiw title=wp:Valhalla>Valhalla</a>, and grazes on the foliage of the tree of <a href=# class=extiw title=wp:Læraðr>Læraðr</a>. As Eikthyrnir feeds on this tree, drips of water flow from its horns, and provides water to the beings of Yggdrasil -- whereas water also symbolizes life, so Xerneas' design might have drawn inspiration from it.</p><p>The hawk, <a href=# class=extiw title=wp:Vedrfolnir>Vedrfolnir</a>, sits between the eyes of another bird, an unnamed eagle. They sit on top of the Yggdrasil, giving the squirrel, Ratatosk, gossips to bring to Nidhogg. Another avian being in Norse Mythology is <a href=# class=extiw title=wp:Hraesvelgr>Hraesvelgr</a>, or the Corpse Swallower, is a <i>jotunn</i> that takes form of an eagle, sits at the "end of the world" or the northern part of the sky. This may be the inspiration for Yveltal's design.</p><p>The serpent, <a href=# class=extiw title=wp:Jormungandr>Jormungandr</a>, also called the Midgard Serpent or World Serpent, is a serpentine creature that is a child of <a href=# class=extiw title=wp:Loki>Loki</a>, along with its siblings, <a href=# class=extiw title=wp:Fenrir>Fenrir</a> and <a href=# class=extiw title=wp:Hel>Hel</a>. Zygarde 50% forme may be a reference to Jormungand, as keeps the world in balance, wrapping the world's circumference with its huge body.</p><p>Zygarde 10% forme may be inspired by Fenrir, a monstrous canine. The green scarf-like structure on Zygarde 10% forme's neck might be a reference to <a href=# class=extiw title=wp:Gleipnir>Gleipnir</a>, a dwarven rope made to bind the canine until <a href=# class=extiw title=wp:Ragnarok>Ragnarok</a>.</p><p>And finally, Zygarde Complete forme may take reference to Hel, God of the Norse Underworld or Helheim, "Land of the Dishonorable Dead." Hel is commonly depicted as half of its body (lengthwise) is alive, and another half is either rotting flesh or a skeleton. This makes sense to Zygarde Complete Forme's blue and red markings on either side, representing life (Xerneas) and destruction (Yveltal), maintaining its theme of balance and order, an equilibrium between mortality. Zygarde's dwelling underground might also have been inspired by the <a href=# class=extiw title=wp:Nidhogg>Nidhogg</a>, a dragon that lives under <a href=# class=extiw title=wp:Midgard>Midgard</a>.</p><p><i>See more info about the origins of the Pokémon of the trio:</i></p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Movesets>Movesets</span></h2><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Base_stat_comparison>Base stat comparison</span></h2><h2><span class=mw-headline id=In_the_games>In the games</span></h2><h3><span id=Pok.C3.A9mon_X_.26_Y></span><span class=mw-headline id=Pokémon_X_&_Y>Pokémon X & Y</span></h3><p>Xerneas and Yveltal are the <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Version mascots">version mascots</a> of <a href=# title="Pokémon X and Y">Pokémon X and Pokémon Y</a> respectively.

The problem is Diancie lacks the power to create a stable Heart Diamond, so it seeks for Xerneas' Fairy Aura, which can revitalize energy.

The team catches a moment with Xerneas and bathed under its Fairy Aura. Xerneas then tells Diancie that Fairy Aura is not what it needs, but there is a power inside Diancie. The chase winds up to <a href=# title="Allearth Forest">Allearth Forest</a> and the activity of every person awakened and enraged the Cocoon of Destruction, Yveltal. Yveltal goes on a rampage and fires <a href=# title="Oblivion Wing (move)">Oblivion Wing</a> all over the place, petrifying the villains and their Pokémon. Yveltal gains on the team, continually firing harmful beams that triggered an extreme emotion within Diancie, enabling it to <a href=# title="Mega Evolution">Mega Evolve</a>, harnessing its true power. Ash's <a href=# title="Ash's Pikachu">Pikachu</a> starts to petrify as its tail was hit by a beam earlier. Before it completely petrifies, Xerneas appears and battles Yveltal, and its mere presence appears to quell Yveltal's rage. Yveltal them fled calmly away from the forest. Xerneas used its Fairy Aura to revitalize the forest, revive the Pokémon and people petrified, including Pikachu. Xerneas then transforms into its dormant form and will look over Allearth Forest for the next thousand years.</p><p>Xerneas made its TV episode debut in <i><a href=# title=XY041>Foggy Pokémon Orienteering!</a></i>, where Ash and friends caught a short glimpse of it without knowing what it is because of the thick fog.</p><p>Zygarde is the central figure of the Pokémon XY&Z season of the anime.

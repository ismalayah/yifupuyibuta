We're told of a massacre of American soldiers at Malmedy, in Belgium, six months after the Normandy invasion; Nazis opened fire on U.S. prisoners and most were killed, but four were able to lose themselves in the surrounding forest. The movie is about their attempt to walk back to the American lines through snow and bitter cold; along the way, they're joined by a British paratrooper who has intelligence about a major Nazi offensive, and they decide they have to get that to the Allies in time to do some good.</p><p>These five soldiers are ordinary people; well, the Americans are, although the Brit seems odd to them, and they don't always appreciate his sense of humor. They are tired and hungry all of the time and guard cigarettes like a precious hoard. Unlike the characters in modern war movies, they don't use four-letter words, and we don't miss them. I don't know if that's accurate or not. Certainly in the 1940s that language was much rarer that it is now, but <a href=#>Norman Mailer</a> uses the F-word all through <i><i>The Naked and the Dead</i></i>, spelling it "fugg" to get it past the censors.</p><p>The movie's hero is quiet and troubled rather than gung-ho. That would be Cpl. Nathan Greer (<a href=#>Corbin Allred</a>), nicknamed "Deacon" because he treasures his Bible and was once a missionary in Berlin. That's where he learned the German that saves them. We assume he's a Mormon, but aren't actually told so. His little group is led by Sgt. Gordon Gunderson (<a href=#>Peter Holden</a>), who shields him from criticism after he freezes at a crucial moment; he's the best sharpshooter in the group, but can he actually kill someone? <a href=#>Steven Gould</a> (<a href=#>Alexander Niver</a>), the medic, is the obligatory soldier from Brooklyn who is required in all World War II movies, and Shirl Kendrick (<a href=#>Lawrence Bagby</a>) is the equally obligatory farm boy from the South. The British pilot, Oberon Winley (<a href=#>Kirby Heyborne</a>), may have seen one <a href=#>David Niven</a> movie too many.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46smKKmpKh6orrDZqqopJSesrO%2FjGtnaWw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.

Either way, if you’re looking to sell any, you could be wondering: are Yu-Gi-Oh cards worth anything?</p><h3 data-injectable=false>How Much Are Yu-Gi-Oh Cards Worth?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/Yu-Gi-Oh-e1452118834475.jpg><p data-characters=182 data-current-count=482 data-injectable=true>Like any other trading card, Yu-Gi-Oh cards are only worth what people are willing to pay, and right now that number can be significant, depending on the exact card you’re selling.</p><p data-characters=193 data-current-count=193 data-injectable=false>With the trading card boom taking place, resale prices have skyrocketed, seeing some tournament-exclusive cards like Tournament Black Luster Soldier from 1999 reportedly selling for $2 million.</p><p data-characters=234 data-current-count=427 data-injectable=true>Even less rare cards fetch quite a handsome price. First edition Blue-Eyes White Dragon, Dark Magician, even Swords of Revealing Light. The older the card, the better for resale value — as long as it’s been kept in good condition.</p><p data-characters=137 data-current-count=137 data-injectable=false>Cards that are new and still played today can also sell for a few hundred dollars. You can check out a great pricing guide on those <a href=#>here</a>.</p><p data-characters=309 data-current-count=446 data-injectable=true>Grading cards can also add a ton of value to your collection. To do this you’ll need to send the card off to a grader who will assign it a rating value. If your card rates at or around a 10 it will get a substantial bump in price, however, again this varies depending on what the card is and how rare it is.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Where to Buy and Sell Yu-Gi-Oh Cards?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/Yu-Gi-Oh-screen-e1452118865574.jpg><p data-characters=143 data-current-count=443 data-injectable=true>You can buy or sell Yu-Gi-Oh cards from some hobbyist stores, but the main place you’re going to want to check out is resale sites like eBay.</p><p data-characters=125 data-current-count=125 data-injectable=false>eBay has plenty of cards for sale from all over the world and likely you’ll find a seller or buyer for what you’re after.</p><p data-characters=163 data-current-count=288 data-injectable=false>If you’re looking to buy something extremely valuable then the best point of call will be auction sites as that is where the high-value pieces are commonly sold.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6hprBlnaqwqXnAq5xmsaVitKp5zqFknJmimcBuw86rq6Fn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

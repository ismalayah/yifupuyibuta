So, that means Probst was age 38 when the reality juggernaut aired its first episode on May 31, 2000.</p><p data-characters=178 data-current-count=178 data-injectable=false>Season 45 is scheduled to premiere in September and since a season runs for around three months, Probst will ring in his 62nd birthday while the show celebrates its 45th season.</p><h2 id=h-probst-doesn-t-appear-ready-to-walk-away-from-survivor-anytime-soon data-injectable=false>Probst doesn’t appear ready to walk away from Survivor anytime soon</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=478 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=433 data-current-count=433 data-injectable=true>Considering Probst is in his 60s and he’s been Survivor’s frontman for its entire existence, the idea of him retiring isn’t a new one — for years, fans and media outlets alike have questioned whether or not Probst’s next season will be his last. But, he made it clear in an exclusive interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Weekly</a> back in December that voting himself off the island wasn’t anywhere in his mind.</p><p data-characters=443 data-current-count=443 data-injectable=true>He admitted to EW that he was feeling the fatigue of Survivor’s filming schedule (they typically shoot two seasons a year in Fiji) after wrapping season 40’s Winners at War in mid-2019. However, with the global pandemic shutting down production, Probst used the opportunity to recharge and reflect. “It gave me a chance to step back and once again reflect on all the things I absolutely love about this show,” he said.</p><p data-characters=122 data-current-count=122 data-injectable=false>Probst went on to explain how important Survivor is to him, and why he “needs” it in his life — even at 61.</p><p data-characters=303 data-current-count=425 data-injectable=true>“It’s impossible to describe what&nbsp;Survivor&nbsp;represents to me,” Probst said. “Impossible.&nbsp;It goes beyond creative expression or professional recognition.&nbsp;It’s much deeper.&nbsp;It’s right in line with the ideas I try to impress on our players.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=309 data-current-count=309 data-injectable=false>“It’s about pushing myself further than I think I can go, about trying to stay in the moment and adapt to my surroundings, about being a good ‘tribe member,’ about being open to new ideas and new people.&nbsp;The same opportunities&nbsp;Survivor&nbsp;offers the players, it offers me.</p><p data-characters=71 data-current-count=380 data-injectable=false>“I love&nbsp;Survivor&nbsp;and I still need&nbsp;Survivor.”</p><p data-characters=91 data-current-count=471 data-injectable=false>Well, Probst, Survivor needs you too, and we hope you don’t go anywhere anytime soon!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ypu9ZmpqWcXZ7Abr%2FUq62irp%2Bneqm70q1ko52Wm3qxvs6bqq1n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

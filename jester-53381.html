However that's barely done anymore and this animes only get an exception because of their popularity but most anime tend to be a little over 20 regardless of whether they're based on a manga or original or popular some animes get second season if they're based on manga or novels or they're really good other animes are only picked for 13 episodes a season mostly to see if it becomes a hit or not.<p>Plus he's also the only other character that's Simon's age and the only one other than Kamina that seems to value him.</p><p>That's the point xD</p><p>Simon is the main character and he really is the leader now...well let's just say that Kamina might've wanted him to be the leader but the rest of Team Dai Gurren didn't approve at first but you'll have to see that for yourself.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV7zJ6km52iqHyrsdKtnKtmZWiAeX2OqZignV1ofQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

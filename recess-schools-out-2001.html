In exile and isolation, his scheme escalated into an attack on the whole summer vacation, and there is a computer simulation of his dream, in which the earth enters a new ice age and the kids presumably all stay inside and study.</p><p>"Recess" is a Disney attempt to reach the same market that Nickelodeon taps with "Rugrats," and although it lacks the zany exuberance of the recent "Rugrats in Paris," it's fast-footed and fun. "Rugrats in Paris" had charms for grownups, however, while "Recess: School's Out" seems aimed more directly at grade-schoolers. That makes the 1960s material problematical; do 9-year-olds really care about ancient history? Even if Myra, the 14-year-old "singing sensation," performs "Dancin' in the Streets" over the end titles? The animation boom has created a lot of voice-over work in Hollywood, and among the voices heard on "Recess" are <a href=#>Dabney Coleman</a> as Principal Prickly, <a href=#>Andy Lawrence</a> as T.J. and <a href=#>Robert Goulet</a> as the singing voice of a character named Mikey (the song is "Green Tambourine," performed in a sequence made by animators who have obviously studied "<a href=#>Yellow Submarine</a>" and the works of Peter Max).</p><p>The movie was directed by <a href=#>Chuck Sheetz</a>, who has worked on "King of the Hill" and "The Simpsons." One of its charms is its defense of recess, which is, we learn, when all the real benefits of primary education take place. I recommend it for kids up to 10 or 11. Parents may find it amusing, but it doesn't have the two-track versatility of "Rugrats in Paris," which worked for kids on one level and adults on another.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46rnJydo6h6tK%2FHqKalq12kwrV5kWlnag%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.

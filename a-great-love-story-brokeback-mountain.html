Because of Ang Lee's clear commitment to strip his film's characters and story of any affectations. Of all his films, this is the one where his protagonists and events are laid bare. And due to the absence of any theatrics or stylistic gesturing, the film is able to retain a strong sense of authenticity, of deeply rooted human connection. Nothing here is pointed out or glossed over. The miracle and tragedy of Jack and Ennis' circumstance speak volumes.</p><p>Much has been made of how uncomfortable the film has made certain audiences, particularly heterosexual males, and that is understandable. But if it is any solace, the physical intimacy displayed here, like the movie itself, is never gratuitous. Their first night together plays out in a way most men might feel after a night when there's been too much to drink, and too much time without a woman. A mistake.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/far-flung-correspondents/a-great-love-story-brokeback-mountain/brokeback_ledger_jake_morning_after-thumb-425x238-36617.jpg width=425 height=238 alt=brokeback_ledger_jake_morning_after.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>But their second tryst is a revelation, both to them and to us. Any mistake brings shame, and yet they both show an unmistakable longing for each other. If that moment was an eye-opener, their re-uniting after several years of being apart brings an undeniable sense of release. Reader, I was happy beyond belief when they were once again in each other's arms.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/far-flung-correspondents/a-great-love-story-brokeback-mountain/brokeback_second_night_together-thumb-425x237-36620.jpg width=425 height=237 alt=brokeback_second_night_together.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/far-flung-correspondents/a-great-love-story-brokeback-mountain/brokeback_second_night_jake-thumb-425x237-36623.jpg width=425 height=237 alt=brokeback_second_night_jake.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>How did Ang Lee pull it off? For one thing, he was able to cast two of the most remarkable young actors at the time, known for their excellent work, and relatively untouched by the baggage of fame. With <a href=#>Jake Gyllenhaal</a> and the late <a href=#>Heath Ledger</a>, they helped create the two most memorable star-crossed lovers of all time.</p><p>We all know how Heath Ledger's role as Ennis Del Mar secured him a place in the pantheon of great screen performances, one so unique it caused <a href=#>Daniel Day-Lewis</a> to honor it as "perfect." Here, he is a clenched fist, so coiled-up that words struggle to leave his lips. It is his damaged past, the "ghost in the room" as Roger Ebert described it, which damages any chance of living happily with his love. But he conveys with equal clarity, a fragile tenderness.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/far-flung-correspondents/a-great-love-story-brokeback-mountain/brokeback_ledger_silent-thumb-425x238-36626.jpg width=425 height=238 alt=brokeback_ledger_silent.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/far-flung-correspondents/a-great-love-story-brokeback-mountain/brokeback_jake_blackhat-thumb-425x230-36629.jpg width=425 height=230 alt=brokeback_jake_blackhat.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>But we shouldn't overlook Jake Gyllenhaal as Jack Twist, the stronger of the two. It is he who is willing to sacrifice more for their happiness, imparting a sensitivity and forgiveness that any partner would want in a soul mate. His suffering may not be as deep as Ennis's, but it's just as painful.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmn5miYrOtwc2gZJynoqeytLzOp5uepqSofKJ5xqucmqxdoby3sYysq6iqqWKvs7vKnpmam5tiurDBza2YoqY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.

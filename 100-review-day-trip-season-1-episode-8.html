The title, “Day Trip,”&nbsp;took on a double meaning, both of which summing up how the characters spent the bulk of their day (or in TV time, roughly 42 minutes) – with a few exceptions. The major one being Octavia (Maria Avgeropoulos), who used the temporary chaos to her advantage and freed her grounder savior, Lincoln (Ricky Whittle).</p><p data-characters=549 data-current-count=549 data-injectable=true>There were several episodes where the only thing keeping Octavia from blending into the background with all the other nondescript members of the group was her tenacity for complaining louder and more obnoxiously than everyone else. The princess title almost seemed better placed at her feet than Clarke’s for a while there, yet despite all her attention whoring, she has developed into one of the most compelling characters on the show. Especially with Finn (Thomas McDonell) falling so far from grace with his recent morally bankrupt actions.</p><p data-characters=812 data-current-count=812 data-injectable=true>In hindsight, Finn will find that his first mistake was failing to mention to Clarke (Eliza Taylor) that he was in a serious relationship prior to being shipped down to Earth. This is something that he might have thought to reveal before he bedded her, not after he was outted. Clarke’s feelings may not have immediately disappeared, but the breach in trust isn’t something he can fix with a simple apology. Even after the shock of Raven’s (Lindsey Morgan) arrival has clearly become an overrated topic, Finn has yet to take a firm stance on the matter. Although Clarke and Raven are enjoying the perks of maturity at the moment, once Raven’s gratitude for the role Clarke played in saving Finn’s life fades, it probably won’t be long before a severe form of jealousy sets in.</p><p data-characters=420 data-current-count=420 data-injectable=true>At the end of the episode, Finn actually attempts to take the moral high ground with Clarke, as she sided with Bellamy (Bob Morley) over him. It’s one thing to preach ethics when you are living a cleaner version of life than your peers, but it’s another thing entirely when you’re just a hypocrite parading around as a pouty teenage boy who is upset because he can’t have his cake and eat it too.</p><p data-characters=36 data-current-count=36 data-injectable=false><i>Continue reading on the next page…</i></p>Pages: <span class="post-page-numbers current" aria-current=page>1</span> <a href=# class=post-page-numbers>2</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3xyfI9mqZ6umZrEbrDAsmStqpmlerSxwKymp2VhYrKxtdKom55laGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

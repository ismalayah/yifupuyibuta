Getting there: Before arriving at Sun Moon Lake I felt like I was off the beaten track, making my way through old rundown towns. It's a very long bus ride to get there, three and a half hours from our previous hotel to be exact, but totally worth it once you do.

It's a very long bus ride to get there, three and a half hours from our previous hotel to be exact, but totally worth it once you do. It is located on the "Sun" side of Sun Moon Lake.</p><p><strong>Check-in experience:</strong> When I walked into the hotel it felt like the scene from Titanic whereall the staff bow to guests as they walk from room to room. Our bags were taken care of and we were escorted to a lounge area where we enjoyed a bowl of almonds and a cool lime juice while our room keys were organised. The view was the most astonishing from the reception on the 8th floor – large windows looking out over the picturesque Sun Moon Lake.</p><p><strong>Room:</strong> The Lakeview Suite. Level 5, room 8. More like an apartment. Three separate rooms with a living room (including luxury sofas and a TV that swerved to face the bedroom too) and a balcony. There were welcome cookies, which was a nice touch.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p><strong>Bathroom:</strong> The toilet was self-contained – it had its own remote control and the seat was heated. There was a shower and separate bath with lavender bath salts, and a double vanity.</p><p><strong>Toiletries:</strong> Everything you could possibly need including a dental kit.</p><p><strong>The bed:</strong> A luxurious king with a plush duvet and comfy mattress.</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> About $850 per night.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p><strong>Facilities:</strong> A 60m infinity pool, gym, sauna, spa, three restaurants, a lobby bar, yoga and meditation classes and a tea store.</p><p><strong>Noise:</strong> The hotel is respectfully quiet. I wouldn't want to take children there for fear of disrupting other guests.</p><p><strong>Food and drink:</strong> Excellent. We dined at the Oriental Brasserie restaurant with a direct view of the lake. The breakfast buffet offered continental and cooked meals as well as Asian options.</p><p><strong>What's in the neighbourhood?</strong> The Lalu is right on the lake and there is a path that leads directly from the hotel to a lakeside walkway, where you can walk as far around the lake as you wish — coming across temples and beautiful plants with descriptive signs. There is a bunch of shops just a 10-minute walk from the hotel, and a golf course nearby.</p><h2 class="related-articles__heading section-travel">Related articles</h2><p><strong>What's so good about this place?</strong> Everything was faultless, but the view and location were particularly mind-blowing.</p><p>Perfect for?

Well, no, you probably haven’t. But Rob Zombie has, and that’s why he’s the guy bringing the beloved monster family back to our screens with his upcoming R-rated <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Munsters</a></strong> reboot. With filming gearing up to start in Budapest, Zombie has been keeping fans updated by sharing all sorts of teases about the project on social media.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=459 data-current-count=459 data-injectable=true>Following on from posting the blueprints to his 100% accurate <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">recreation of the Munsters’ house</a>, the filmmaker has now shared some costume designs for the Munster ma and pa’s pajamas. In doing so, Zombie has given us our first glimpse at how the iconic married couple will be visually depicted in the reboot. And, just as you’d expect from a mega-fan like Zombie, they look to be very faithful to their designs in the original 1960s sitcom.</p><p>“What do Herman and Lily wear to bed? Perhaps something like this!” Zombie wrote in his caption to the images. “Check out some wardrobe designs by our amazing costume designers.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/217159148_884004462203213_4348584351538300532_n.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/217483817_1138213120034005_6945462488962897191_n.jpg><p data-characters=409 data-current-count=613 data-injectable=true>The pics showcases Lily (who’ll be <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">played by Sheri Moon Zombie</a>) in a gothic nightgown and robe sporting a cobwebbed pattern, while Herman (Jeff Daniel Phillips) dons an old-fashioned nightshirt and hat adorned with skull-shaped buttons. Just as Lily’s sporting her black-and-white hair and vampiric complexion, Herman looks to have retained his Frankenstein-like appearance, including neck-bolts.</p><p data-characters=416 data-current-count=416 data-injectable=true>The last time the Munsters were brought to the screen was Bryan Fuller’s failed pilot Mockingbird Lane, starring Jerry O’Connell and Portia de Rossi, which reimagined the family as looking human. So fans will be pleased that Zombie isn’t going down this route and is rooting his take on the material in the classic show. Just probably with a lot more gore, violence and foul language, knowing him.</p><p data-characters=220 data-current-count=220 data-injectable=false><strong>The Munsters</strong> will also feature the likes of Dan Roebuck, Jorge Garcia and Cassandra “Elvira” Peterson in its cast. It’s expected to release in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">both theaters and on Peacock</a> when it eventually gets here.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoqaiaXa%2B8rq7InmSsoJGnsrR5y6KjsmWRo7FutMSrpJqmXZi8r6%2FEqatmmaKpeqe70WaroZ1dosKvv9OeqaxlopqvsLvTaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

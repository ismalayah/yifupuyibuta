Now, these fans are looking at who they think did the best job of playing the character of Bruce Wayne specifically.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=452 data-current-count=452 data-injectable=true>Playing the role of Bruce Wayne is no easy feat. The character is constantly torn between having to keep up with his hedonistic lifestyle to keep everyone fooled, actually overseeing his company without appearing to be too invested, and of course, spending his remaining time keeping on top of his vigilante efforts as Batman.

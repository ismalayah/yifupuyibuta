Mimey doesn't have to be a badass battler in order for it to be interesting and, no matter how you or others try to spin it, turning it into one (as well as turning it into a copy of the <i>Detective Pikachu</i> Mr. Mime) goes against the character. Mimey was always shown to be helpful and to enjoy aiding people (especially Delia). Yet now, its tendencies to act more like a mime are turning it into a nuisance/gag that makes it unhelpful. Mimey was shown to care most about Delia, since she was the person it bonded with the most (to the point that it and Ash wouldn't even get along because of that during the OG series). But now, it's been retconned that it was Ash's Pokémon all along. Mimey was always shown to be mainly interested in cleaning, helping with shopping and doing chores. But now, its suddenly shown to also be interested in kung fu and Pokémon battle (and shown to be incredible at them, despite having never participated in an official one before). All of this is terrible writing and completely unnecessary, as there are many ways they could've made Mimey interesting without sacrificing its character. Take, for example, Kliera from <i>Monsters Can't Clean</i>. She's an endearing and pretty lovable character who is able to help people and monsters by make their lives brighter with the "magic" of cleaning and who manages to have her own cool moments without having to be an ultra-mega-hype-super-warrior that can beat stronger opponents in a fight (she actually has moments in which she's shown to not be that strong, but her being weaker than others doesn't make her terrible). Something similar could've been done with Mimey: the writers could've had an episode dedicated to showing Mimey and its personality and how intriguing and likable it can be, despite not being a strong battler, which would build on what came before and lead to it becoming more of an interesting character without having to completely rewrite its character.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHyuvoymoKadXZeyrbvNoKpmrJ9irrS0jJqanKeimbavs4ytpmasmJp6sLLFopqimZxiwbi1062cq2ZibIR4gY9o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

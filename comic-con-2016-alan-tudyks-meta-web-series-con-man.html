Wash was married to the ship's first mate, Zoe (<a href=#>Gina Torres</a>).&nbsp;The premise of the series, which crossed the Western with science fiction, was that China and the United States had merged into a single powerful diplomatic partnership called the Alliance. The planets that exist outside of the Alliance's control were lawless like the 19th-century American West. Reynolds' spaceship is named after the Battle of Serenity Valley, a decisive battle between the Independents or Browncoats who wanted to remain independent of the Alliance, but ultimately lost.</p><p>In the wilderness of this space opera, a cannibalistic tribe of savage humans, the Reavers, threaten the settlers, traders and other space pioneers. In the movie, Wash dies near the end, killed by the Reavers.</p><p>To understand "Con Man" and the "Con Man" panel, you have to know all this and know that each year at San Diego Comic-Con. There are also special meetings where Browncoats unite. 2012's Comic-Con featured a 10th anniversary panel reunion at SDCC with Joss Whedon, Tim Minear, Nathan Fillion, Alan Tudyk, <a href=#>Summer Glau</a>, <a href=#>Adam Baldwin</a> and <a href=#>Sean Maher</a>. Yet references to "Firefly" go beyond gatherings of geeks.&nbsp;The CBS sitcom, "The Big Bang Theory," has referenced the show as did the NBC comedy "Community."&nbsp;<span>"Con Man" set crowd-funding records by raising more than a million dollars&nbsp;</span><span>in 24 hours</span><span>&nbsp;through Indiegogo.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Written and directed by Tudyk, "Con Man" is about a struggling actor named Wray Nerely (Tudyk) who once played a main cast member, a pilot, in a 2002 science fiction TV series, "Spectrum," and makes money by hitting the comic and science-fiction convention circuit because the canceled series has a huge cult following. His good friend Jack Moore (Nathan Fillion), who starred as the spaceship's captain, has been much more successful.</p><p>Wray may be a star at the conventions and comic stores where he appears, but he lives in a one-bedroom apartment hoping for guest-starring roles in any TV series that will take him. Wray's predicament isn't helped by his booking agent, Bobbie (Mindy Sterling), who finds ways of increasing her 15 percent take of all the money that Wray makes—usually by increasing his suffering.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmn52RqcKzsdJomqilmZh6pLvNZmlpaWZirq2tzWarrpypoMBuucStmGavlZd6tLHRopysZZOku265wKc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

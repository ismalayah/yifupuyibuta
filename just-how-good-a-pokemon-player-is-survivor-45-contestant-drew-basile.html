We don’t know. This is mostly because according to the extraordinary competitive Pokémon database <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Limitless VGC</a>, there are no notable placements for a player going by the name Drew Basile. This means that even if he has competed or even done well at the tournament level, he has never managed to crack the top cut of those events. Thus, his win and loss records, alongside the teams of Pokémon he chose to use, are likely still his private information, unless he chooses to share it with the world.</p><p data-characters=278 data-current-count=278 data-injectable=false>Unfortunately, he may not find future success either, as his competitive future has been put in jeopardy by Survivor itself. On the show, he mentioned he used hacked Pokémon, which is strictly against the rules, and has resulted in players <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">being disqualified</a> from competition.</p><p data-characters=468 data-current-count=746 data-injectable=false>Basile himself seemed to realize the error of mentioning it at all. “Survivor rlly just exposed I hack my Pokémon,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he posted</a> on X, formerly known as Twitter. His only hope is that Officer Jenny might let him off the hook, or that Nintendo isn’t watching too closely. But considering how weirdly intense the company is with regard to competitive rules for all of their video games… Sorry, Drew, you might have to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">get into Digimon now</a>, instead.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yrwdKtZKGnp2K0sLvDZphmqJ%2Bgsq67zWanpZmpmr9utdJmqq6qpp7DsL6MbWxmm5%2Bjwaa%2F05qlrWWUp7K4ecGaqqKklWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

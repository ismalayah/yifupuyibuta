Maxie lost the Blue Orb when <a href=# title="Ash's Pikachu">Pikachu</a> became possessed by it after grabbing the orb off of Maxie's desk. It was shown that the both orbs can be absorbed into the body of and possess any person or Pokémon that touches them. This can happen instantly, as was the case with Pikachu, or over time, as was the case with Archie. A human or Pokémon being possessed by one of the orbs will have the corresponding Legendary Pokémon's special red or blue markings appear on their body. While possessed, Archie was still able to control Kyogre, but Pikachu went on a wild rampage. When Kyogre was hit by Groudon's <a href=# title="Solar Beam (move)">Solar Beam</a>, the Red Orb extracted itself from Archie's body and he lost consciousness briefly. The Blue Orb also extracted itself from Pikachu. When he woke up, Archie seemed to have no memory of what happened while he was possessed.

They first appeared in <i><a href=# title=PS228>I'm Always Grumpig First Thing in the Morning II</a></i>, being guarded by <a href=# title="Tate and Liza">Tate and Liza</a> on Mt. Pyre. Despite their best efforts to protect the Orbs, they were eventually stolen by <a href=# title="Magma Admin (Trainer class)">Magma Admin</a> <a href=# title=Blaise>Blaise</a>. In <i><a href=# title=PS234>The Beginning of the End with Kyogre & Groudon II</a></i>, at the <a href=# title="Seafloor Cavern">Seafloor Cavern</a>, Maxie used the Orbs to awaken both <a href=# title="Super-ancient Pokémon (Adventures)">Groudon</a> and <a href=# title="Super-ancient Pokémon (Adventures)">Kyogre</a>, intending to give the former the advantage by using the Orbs. However, as controlling two Legendary Pokémon at the same time started to take too much of his mental capacity, he had the Blue Orb be taken away by <a href=# title=Tabitha>Tabitha</a> so that he could focus on controlling Groudon. While doing what he had been ordered to do, Tabitha was ambushed by <a href=# title="Amber (Adventures)">Amber</a>, who used his <a href=# title="Volbeat (Pokémon)">Volbeat</a>'s <a href=# title="Trick (move)">Trick</a> to steal the Blue Orb and deliver it to Archie.</p><p>Later, <a href=# title="Ruby (Adventures)">Ruby</a> and <a href=# title="Sapphire (Adventures)">Sapphire</a> faced Maxie and Archie in a battle, but had difficulty in reaching them. After Ruby's <a href=# title="Castform (Pokémon)">Castform</a>, <a href=# title=Fofo>Fofo</a>, finally managed to defeat the two evil team leaders with <a href=# title="Weather Ball (move)">Weather Ball</a>, Ruby tried to take the Orbs from Maxie and Archie's hands, only to find out that they had started to merge with their holders, making him unable to remove them. Realizing that should the Orbs be absorbed completely, they could never be retrieved, Ruby had <a href=# title=Kiki>Kiki</a> use <a href=# title="Covet (move)">Covet</a> on them, but failed. The Orbs then completely merged with the two men, causing the patterns of Groudon and Kyogre to appear on their arms, indicating that <i>they</i> were now being controlled by the Legendary Pokémon, instead of the other way around. Maxie and Archie grabbed Ruby and Sapphire, and started to fly away, the Orbs' powers being called by Groudon and Kyogre.</p><p>After the two Legendary Pokémon had started to battle at <a href=# title="Sootopolis City">Sootopolis City</a>, Ruby and Sapphire realized that with the <a href=# title=Meteorite>Meteorite</a> fragments given to them by <a href=# title=Winona>Winona</a>, they could stop the Orbs' influence over Maxie and Archie, due to them having the ability to stop the power of nature. Using a <a href=# title="Wild Pokémon">wild</a> <a href=# title="Absol (Pokémon)">Absol</a>'s <a href=# title="Magic Coat (move)">Magic Coat</a> to reflect the meteorite's energy at the two evil team leaders, Ruby and Sapphire were able to turn them back to normal, but also caused a large burst of energy in the process, knocking the two Trainers unconscious. They later woke up at <a href=# title="Mirage Island (Generation III)">Mirage Island</a>, where they then spent some time training with <a href=# title=Juan>Juan</a>, Tate, and Liza, preparing for the final battle. During the training, Ruby found out that the Orbs needed a human to control them, so that their powers could be maximized, and be absorbed into their controllers. This led him to realize that the Orbs were now inside of him and Sapphire, having chosen them as their new controllers. Juan told Ruby and Sapphire that they needed to learn to control the Orbs, because if their minds weren't strong enough, they would wind up getting controlled by them, just like Maxie and Archie. During the training, <a href=# title=Courtney>Courtney</a> showed up and offered her help for Ruby to stop the battle between Kyogre and Groudon, as everything had already gone beyond anything Team Magma or Team Aqua wanted, and there was no point in letting the entire <a href=# title=Hoenn>Hoenn</a> <a href=# title=Region>region</a> get destroyed. At first, Ruby was reluctant to accept the offer, but eventually agreed in order to protect Sapphire from being possessed by the Blue Orb.</p><p>After completing their training, Ruby and Sapphire left the Mirage Island and arrived near Sootopolis City. Having already extracted the Red Orb from his body and having Sapphire extract the Blue Orb from her body, Ruby locked her inside <a href=# title=Wallace>Wallace</a>'s aircar to protect her, before leaving with Courtney. They tried to stop the battle between the two Legendary Pokémon, but without success. However, as <a href=# title=Norman>Norman</a> arrived with <a href=# title="Super-ancient Pokémon (Adventures)">Rayquaza</a>, the third super-ancient Pokémon of Hoenn, Ruby was able to combine its power with the power of the Orbs to finally stop the fight and calm down Kyogre and Groudon, sending them to continue their slumber. Archie and Maxie then emerged from the <a href=# title="Cave of Origin">Cave of Origin</a>, stealing the Orbs back in order to restart the fight, but were stopped by <a href=# title="Ruby's Plusle">Plusle</a> and <a href=# title="Sapphire's Minun">Minun</a>. With the two men immobilized, Ruby sent out his sixth Pokémon—<a href=# title="Celebi (Adventures)">Celebi</a>—to swipe the Orbs and destroy them, effectively putting the conflict to an end.</p><p>Afterward, the gemstones that were formed from the shattered Orbs were picked up by <a href=# title="Giovanni (Adventures)">Giovanni</a>, who revealed that these gemstones were actually the Orbs' true forms: the <a href=# title="Ruby (item)">Ruby</a> and the <a href=# title="Sapphire (item)">Sapphire</a>. Blaise secretly witnessed this, and decided to keep track of the Orbs with his <a href=# title=Scanner>Scanner</a>.</p><p>While the Jade Orb has not appeared in the Pokémon Adventures manga, Norman revealed in <i><a href=# title=PS264>It All Ends Now V</a></i> that the reason why the <a href=# title="Pokémon Association">Pokémon Association</a> once captured and studied Rayquaza was in an attempt to create an artificial Green Orb (Japanese: 翠色の宝珠 <i>Green Orb</i>) in order to control it, but they failed to complete it.</p><h4><span class=mw-headline id=Emerald_arc><a href=# title="Emerald arc (Adventures)"><i>Emerald</i> arc</a></span></h4><p>In <i><a href=# title=PS327>Facing Gulpin Is Hard to Swallow</a></i>, it was revealed that <a href=# title=Spenser>Spenser</a> had also once touched the Blue Orb, causing him to start having nightmares about Kyogre, as well as allowing him to recognize people who had done the same—namely Sapphire and <a href=# title="Guile Hideout">Guile Hideout</a>—based on a signature dim glow that they had in their eyes.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=PS331>The Final Battle IV</a></i>, the core of the unfinished Green Orb was revealed to have been thrown away by <a href=# title="Professor Yanase Berlitz">Professor Yanase</a> and subsequently found by <a href=# title="Emerald (Adventures)">Emerald</a>, who started wearing it as a part of his accessories. In <i><a href=# title=PS336>The Final Battle IX</a></i>, Ruby theorized that the core's power to control Pokémon had helped Emerald in calming down the Pokémon that had been rampaging due to Guile Hideout's influence.</p><h4><span id=Omega_Ruby_.26_Alpha_Sapphire_arc></span><span class=mw-headline id=Omega_Ruby_&_Alpha_Sapphire_arc><a href=# title="Omega Ruby & Alpha Sapphire arc (Adventures)"><i>Omega Ruby & Alpha Sapphire</i> arc</a></span></h4><p>In <i><a href=# title=PS607>Blastoise Transforms</a></i>, <a href=# title="Bill (Adventures)">Bill</a> revealed that the Ruby and Sapphire, which he had been keeping at the <a href=# title="Sea Cottage">Sea Cottage</a> ever since <a href=# title="Team Rocket">Team Rocket</a>'s defeat, had been regenerating over time back into their states as the Orbs, leading him to realize that the Orbs were manifestations of Hoenn's natural energy. The Orbs were later stolen by Archie and Maxie, who headed back to Hoenn with them. When Amber and Blaise manipulated <a href=# title="Hoopa (Pokémon)">Hoopa</a> into summoning Groudon and Kyogre through its rings, the two super-ancient Pokémon started moving towards the Orbs. When the Legendary duo reached Maxie and Archie, the villainous team leaders let them fuse together with the Orbs, causing them both to undergo Primal Reversion.</p><p>In <a href=# title=PS611>PS611</a>, Emerald was revealed to have given the Green Orb core to Norman, who took it to the research facility where Rayquaza was held in captivity and used a machine to increase its purity. The process changed the core to a jade color and increased its strength. Despite the increase in strength, Norman was unable to utilize the core to control Rayquaza. When Ruby used the core, he was able to slightly control Rayquaza enough to influence its movements.

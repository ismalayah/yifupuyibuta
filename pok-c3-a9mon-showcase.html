Contestants are allowed to use up to six <a href=# title="Pokémon (species)">Pokémon</a>. In essence, they are similar to <a href=# title="Pokémon world in relation to the real world">real-world</a> <a href=# class=extiw title="wp:beauty pageant">beauty pageants</a>. There are two classes of Pokémon Showcases, the Rookie Class and the Master Class. Every <a href=# title="Pokémon Performer">Performer</a> may compete in the Rookie Class, but only those who have collected at least three <a href=# title="Princess Key">Princess Keys</a> can enter the Master Class.</p><p>Rookie Class tournaments are divided in two sections. The first is called the <b>Theme Performance</b> (Japanese: <b>テーマパフォーマンス</b> <i>Theme Performance</i>) and can encompass different activities. The activity of the Theme Performance depends on the specific Showcase tournament. This section usually takes place in multiple rounds, with three contestants per round facing off against each other, though only the winner of each round will move on to the next section. However, as the Theme Performance varies between tournaments, the criteria for winning them also differs.</p><p>The second section is called the <b>Freestyle Performance</b> (Japanese: <b>フリーパフォーマンス</b> <i>Free Performance</i>), which is the same in each Pokémon Showcase. The <a href=# title="Pokémon Performer">Performer</a> and her Pokémon perform together on stage, making full use of the Pokémon's capabilities. It is similar to the <a href=# title=Appeal>Performance Stage</a> of a <a href=# title="Pokémon Contest">Pokémon Contest</a>. However, unlike <a href=# title="Pokémon Coordinator">Coordinators</a>, Performers must be involved in an active part of the performance, since Showcase performances also focus on the Trainers and their ability to perform alongside their Pokémon, whereas in Pokémon Contests the Pokémon are always the main attraction.</p><p>In the Freestyle Performance, contestants are judged by the audience. Each Performer gets a heart-shaped key used to receive votes from the audience. Each person in the audience can bring out one vote on a special voting device called the <b>Glow Caster</b> (Japanese: <b>ポケリウム</b> <i>Poké Lume</i>), which sends out small luminous balls of light that connect to the keys of the participants according to the color of their key. The participant with the key that absorbs the most lights is decided the winner.</p><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/e/ee/Pok%C3%A9mon_Showcase_Glowsticks.png/375px-Pok%C3%A9mon_Showcase_Glowsticks.png decoding=async width=250 height=141 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> The crowd using the Glow Caster to vote<p>The Master Class is the Showcase equivalent for the <a href=# title="Pokémon League Conference">Pokémon League Conference</a> of the <a href=# title="Pokémon League">Pokémon League</a> and the <a href=# title="Grand Festival">Grand Festival</a> of the <a href=# title="Pokémon Contest">Pokémon Contests</a>. The contestants have to deliver Freestyle Performances from the very beginning as there are no Theme Performance rounds. The competing Performers are divided into trios and whoever receives the highest number of votes is declared the winner of their group and advances to the next round. In rounds prior to the semifinals, each Performer gets a turn performing individually before the three of them perform at the same time. They must perform with a single Pokémon and they are allowed to affect the performances of each other.</p><p>During the semifinals, Performers are called on stage one at a time and they have to perform using two Pokémon. The winning Performer advances to the final round, where the current <a href=# title="Pokémon Performer">Kalos Queen</a> awaits. As the winner of the previous Master Class competition, the Kalos Queen has a guaranteed spot in the final round, where she must defend her title. Performers are allowed to use up to six Pokémon in the finals. One notable difference between the Rookie Class and the Master Class is the voting system; while in the Rookie Class only the Glow Caster can be used to vote, in the Master Class people all over the Kalos region are able to vote by using devices similar to <a href=# class=extiw title=wp:smartphone>smartphones</a>.</p><p>Rookie Class winners receive a <a href=# title="Princess Key">Princess Key</a>, and the Master Class winner receives the title of Kalos Queen.

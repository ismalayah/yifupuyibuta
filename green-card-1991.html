The main characters - a Frenchman and an American woman who have to pretend their marriage is the real thing - solemnly explain to an immigration official that they met when they ran into each other, their packages fell to the ground, etc.</p><p>Actually the whole movie is a slightly more sophisticated application of the same formula. The Frenchman, played by <a href=#>Gerard Depardieu</a>, needs a green card if he is to stay in America. The woman, played by <a href=#>Andie MacDowell</a>, needs a husband if she is to rent a desirable Manhattan apartment. They are introduced by a friend, they go through the fiction of a marriage ceremony, and then when immigration comes sniffing around they have to put on a convincing show of really being married.</p><p>A movie like "Green Card" can supply two kinds of pleasures: those caused when it observes its formula, and those created when it violates it. The movie was written and directed by <a href=#>Peter Weir</a> ("<a href=#>Dead Poets Society</a>," "<a href=#>Witness</a>"), who constructs it lovingly according to sturdy old principles: The couple is at first indifferent to one another, then hostile, then in love, then in denial, and then of course they break up - right before they get together. All of these stops are observed, but at the same time Weir has added some nice touches, including the unconventional characters themselves.</p><p>Depardieu, the leading actor in France, here making his American film debut, is a large, shaggy, untidy man who brings to every role a kind of effortless charm. He occupies a considerable psychic space on the screen. It is not hard to figure out his practical reasons for wanting to marry MacDowell. But her character has its work cut out: Would an attractive young woman, smart and with a great job, actually marry a stranger just to get an apartment? In Manhattan, this movie argues, the answer is yes - especially if the apartment incorporates a large solarium. We accept the marriage of convenience for the purposes of the plot, but the screenplay still has some explaining to do.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46gqZ6dnmKwor7DZmhycWE%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.

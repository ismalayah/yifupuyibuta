He was so impacting as Frasier, even among a number of other lead cast members, that a spin-off directly following the character — fittingly titled Frasier — debuted the same year Cheers concluded. Following his nearly 10-year stint on Cheers, Grammer went on to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">enjoy another decade</a> (almost) in the role.</p><p data-characters=547 data-current-count=946 data-injectable=true>But it gets even more impressive. Frasier initially concluded, just under a decade into its run, back in 2004. Grammer stepped away from his iconic role for nearly 20 years, but in 2023 the opportunity to once again grace audiences with the fan-favorite character reared its head. Frasier returned, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">still starring Grammer</a>, in October of 2023, and made him one of exceedingly few actors to maintain a role over nearly 40 years. He didn’t play it constantly over the course of those four decades, but his consistency is impressive nonetheless.</p><p data-characters=449 data-current-count=449 data-injectable=true>Grammer is known for plenty outside of his signature turn, of course, but it remains one of his most identifiable roles. On top of Frasier and Cheers, he’s appeared in a huge number of releases, stretching from his first days on screen in the late ’70s all the way to modern day. The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">recently-released Frasier reboot</a> is highlighting just how relevant Grammer remains, but with a bank account like his we doubt he really needed reminding.</p><h2 id=h-kelsey-grammer-s-net-worth data-injectable=false>Kelsey Grammer’s net worth</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Kelsey_Grammer.jpg><p data-characters=507 data-current-count=807 data-injectable=true>Over nearly 45 years on our screens, Grammer has established himself as one of television’s greats. He’s wonderful on the big screen as well, of course, buts its on the small screen <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">that Grammer truly shines</a>. He’s been in far more television shows than cinematic releases, and they are what he’s remembered best for. They’re also the primary culprit behind the 68-year-old’s current net worth, which stands more than $80 million strong, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>.</p><p data-characters=525 data-current-count=525 data-injectable=false>Grammer’s cushy bank account would be overflowing were it not for several high-dollar divorces, which drained a painful amount of that Frasier cash. Back at the show’s height, he was making a reported $1.6 million per episode, netting around $38 million per season. Without any of the financial hits he’s taken through his life, he’d likely be worth at least double his current number, but no one’s scoffing at $80 million. Its still a starkly impressive figure, and a well-earned one at that.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZqCsZZuaubSx2Gaeq5mdorKzv4ynnK1lp6S%2FtbSMoqVmamBngHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

Shortly after, the video of the incident went viral on social media. Now, everyone’s wondering if she’s okay. Read on for an update on her health condition!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@schwartz.alissa</a><p>Alissa Carlson Schwartz</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Meteorologist Alissa Carlson Schwartz fainted on live TV. Is she OK? Here’s a health update.</h2><p>Following her on-screen <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">health scare</a>, Alissa took to social media to assure fans that she was OK. “Thanks for all the calls, texts, and well wishes,” she wrote in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a> post. Later, she revealed that she had been released from the hospital, where she was treated for a head injury.</p><p>Alissa joined <a href=#>Gayle King</a> on <a href=#>CBS Mornings</a> on Tuesday, March 21. During their interview, the meteorologist shared what really happened on Saturday. “In the morning, I felt fine,” she said.</p><p>“It wasn't really up until about 15 minutes prior to the incident that I started to feel a little [nauseous] and at that point, I went to the restroom and thought, 'OK, I'll be fine, I'll get through the hit and I'll get something to eat,'” adding that she had skipped breakfast that morning.</p><p>“I also had been drinking a lot of coffee and so most likely I was maybe a little dehydrated.”</p><p>Despite feeling sick, Alissa pushed on and attempted to “power through” her segment.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>Instead, she ended up being rushed to the hospital. According to Alissa, she was previously diagnosed with a condition called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">vasovagal syncope</a>, which was what caused her to pass out on air.</p><p>“It hadn't happened in a while and I'm now going to have to learn how to really recognize the symptoms of this condition,” Alissa added.</p><p>As of this writing, Alissa is on a temporary leave of absence, however, the CBS Los Angeles meteorologist assured fans that she’d return to the small screen after spending some time in recovery.</p><p>“Sometimes we put ourselves last. We go, go, go until something happens,'” she said. But Alissa won’t be making that mistake again.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@schwartz.alissa</a><p>Alissa Carlson Schwartz</p></figure><p>After all, this isn’t the first time she’s had issues with her health while on set. In the past, she was diagnosed with a heart condition.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Alissa Carlson Schwartz was diagnosed with a heart condition in 2014.</h2><p>During her appearance on CBS Mornings, Alissa also opened up about being diagnosed with a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">leaky heart valve</a>, which made her recent health scare even scarier.</p><p>“Initially, when this happened, I think a lot of people — including myself — thought I was having a heart attack on the air … that was not the case, thankfully,” she said. In fact, Alissa said her heart is doing “great” these days, and we love that for her.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhforK1sc6rpqWnl57AtXnApaCsq5FisKK%2By6ymp2WjmLW4rdGtsWaglZa5tbQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

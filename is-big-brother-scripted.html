While the interpersonal dynamics depicted in the house are real, other parts of the show are given a polish by the production crew behind the scenes. The moments at the start of each season where houseguests are ‚Äúsurprised‚Äù with their keys are clearly fake, as the presence of a camera crew and the over-the-top reactions you can see in previous guest montages on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube</a> show. As well, while everyone playing the game knows what happens during nominations and the veto ceremonies, the person leading them still reads from a written sheet to explain how it all works to the audience, and as audience members have confirmed, Julie Chen <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">does</a> read copy from a teleprompter.</p><p data-characters=626 data-current-count=626 data-injectable=true>So, knowing these aspects of media manipulation are present, the other question is, just how much of the game we see playing out each summer is genuine to what is actually happening within the house? Most of the time, it appears to be true to the actual twists and turns, but, the diary room where contestants go to give thoughts to production about what is happening is a product of manipulation much of the time. Christine from Big Brother 16 reveals in a 2020 tweet all of her dialogue was pre-written by the show‚Äôs fifth week and says she even reportedly got a condescending nickname for not liking her given lines.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>My DR sessions were 100% production written by around week 5, I was getting so frustrated with them making me say stuff I didn‚Äôt believe in, or NOT how it happened, that production ended up calling me crabby christine üëçüèº</p>‚Äî Christine Varner (@MeanyChristiney) <a href=#>July 29, 2020</a></figure><p data-characters=303 data-current-count=603 data-injectable=true>Earlier seasons like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Big Brother 8</a> have also seen issues surrounding cheating like when Dick admitted to having his son pass him messages through code in a letter. He was allowed to stay in the game and subsequently won, and in Big Brother 21, a player was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">caught eating</a> non-approved food as a have-not.</p><p data-characters=316 data-current-count=316 data-injectable=false>So, ultimately, while the long-running franchise can be enjoyable, and in some cases, genuinely compelling (Dick and Daniele reconnecting albeit briefly during the eighth season was interesting), it should also be taken with a grain of salt. The project is designed to entertain and make money before anything else.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yqv4yboKBlkqe8tbTEq2Ssm6KevbWxw2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
